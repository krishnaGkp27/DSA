    <h1>Hi, I'am Krishna</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> A software engineer by profession with 3 years of industry experience.</p>
    <p>
        I started my career as assistant system engineer in TCS as a software developer.
        I worked in front-end using JSP pages and javaScript in an enterprise JAVA application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later I switched to backend related work dealing with JDBC and oracle database. Used API's
        like Solace messaging bus, Spring MVC. I worked on some dev-ops related work like puppet deployment tool
        and bamboo build. Used Linux as deployment server using it's various commands.
        Used Git Sami as application version control.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am willing to explore myself with both front-end and back-end to chose what is best for me
        going ahead in future.
    </p>
